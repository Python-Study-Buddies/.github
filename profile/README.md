## Hi there 👋

## Welcome to the Python Study Buddy community! Our group aims to empower women who are interested in learning how to code and who are interested in exploring the programming language Python. 

## Take a look at our community guidelines to get a better understanding of who we are.

Community Updates and Guidelines  :bulb:@channel @everyone
We have new exciting updates to the Python Study Buddies Community! :partying_face: To ensure a positive and focused environment, we’ve established the following guidelines:
1. Community Involvement: Everyone joined this group with a genuine interest in learning Python or improving their knowledge. For our community to thrive, active involvement is crucial. This community will not be a waste of time. Our Slack will not be a dead end. It is a new creation and a new path. We aim to be a successful community, and we will absolutely meet our goals. We are here to support each other in achieving our goals, and this starts with open communication and active participation in our chat and in our meetings. Everyone in this community has a role and everyone has a responsibility. :busts_in_silhouette:
2. Membership Closure: Our group is currently closed to new members to ensure the quality of our Python learning experience and prevent community management from becoming a distraction. This allows members to not only concentrate on their Python learning journey, but also thrive in it. Group closure is not permanent, new select members may be added in the future. :white_check_mark:
3. Meeting Agendas: Each meeting will have a predefined agenda, providing a structured outline for discussions and group goals. This helps us make the most of our time together. :spiral_calendar_pad:

Thank you to 
@Alexandra
 for creating this for us. :sparkling_heart:
4. Learning Structure: Our learning follows the book “Python for Everybody: Exploring Data Using Python 3” by Dr. Charles R. Severance. The first two weeks of each month are dedicated to studying a chapter, while the remaining two weeks focus on exercises and practical application. :books:
Book Link is here: https://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf.
Shoutout to 
@Danya Hernandez
 for providing this resource. :two_hearts:
5. GitHub Collaboration: We have a public GitHub organization for collaborative app development and open-source projects. This platform allows us to showcase our skills and discussions to the wider community. You can also include this membership in your LinkedIn profile. :computer:

Thank you 
@amogha kancharla
 for creating this for us .:cherry_blossom:
6. Additional Resources: We welcome the use of videos and articles as supplementary learning materials to enhance our understanding of the Python programming language. Our community has a #resources channel, if you come across any additional resources that could enhance our understanding, you are encouraged to add them to that channel. :arrow_forward:
We all have our own personal goals and desires. We are all here for a reason. I know that because we are behind screens, that it may be easy to forget. But we are not just another social media group. We are an actual community. We are here to thrive. We are here to learn. We are here to collaborate. We are here to experience synergy. And that is exactly what we will do. :sunrise:
